🚍 Java Console-Based Bus Reservation & Management System

A Java-based console application for booking and managing bus services.
This project provides two types of roles with different access levels:

🛠 Admin
Add, view, edit, and delete bus details

View all reservations made by users

👤 User
View available buses

Make, cancel, or edit reservations

Check personal reservation details

This system follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and uses a menu-driven interface for smooth navigation. All interactions happen directly in the command line, making it lightweight and fast.
